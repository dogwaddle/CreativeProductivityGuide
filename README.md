# All the information is Stored in the Wiki

The _**wiki**_ is where you are going to house all the information you need as you come across it and organize it. Then in the _**code sections**_, that is where you'll **distill** all the **information** and **create** a **comic book** out of it. 

In the code section you'll have readme files that serve as scripts and then you'll upload drawings of the actual comic pages as you complete them.

# Idea 1

Make this into the Cartoon Guide to Creative Genius

# Idea 2

Make this into an interactive scrollable website that evolves, using the same art as Idea 1. 

**Starts Out** - Has a navigation sidebar on the right. On the left is basically an endless scroll of the wiki combined with drawings but made into a narrative, still similar to Cartoon Guides, but perhaps less visually intense? It would be like if you just made the comic book a scrollable website. 

**Evolves Too** - The same as the above but it becomes a lot more interactive and visual. Would this make sense? What this gets down to is communication. Would adding bells and whistles like interactivity actually help make the material more readable? 

There are two elements to this: 
1. Interactivity would make it more engaging? Is that true? 
2. Interactivity would... lost this train of thought. What else does interactivity help with? 
3. Does it help with communication at all? 
4. How would interactivity distract or harm the overall concept?
