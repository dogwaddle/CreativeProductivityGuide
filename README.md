The wiki is where you are going to house all the information you need as you come across it and organize it. Then in the code sections, that is where you'll distill all the information and create a comic book out of it. In the code section you'll have readme files that serve as scripts and then you'll upload drawings of the actual comic pages as you complete them.


## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/dogwaddle/CreativeGeniusGuide/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/dogwaddle/CreativeGeniusGuide/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
