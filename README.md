# All the information is Stored in the Wiki

The _**wiki**_ is where you are going to house all the information you need as you come across it and organize it. Then in the _**code sections**_, that is where you'll **distill** all the **information** and **create** a **comic book** out of it. 

In the code section you'll have readme files that serve as scripts and then you'll upload drawings of the actual comic pages as you complete them.

# Idea 1

Make this into the Cartoon Guide to Creative Genius

# Idea 2

Make this into an interactive scrollable website that evolves, using the same art as Idea 1. 

**Starts Out** - Has a navigation sidebar on the right. On the left is basically an endless scroll of the wiki combined with drawings but made into a narrative, still similar to Cartoon Guides, but perhaps less visually intense? It would be like if you just made the comic book a scrollable website. 

**Evolves Too** - The same as the above but it becomes a lot more interactive and visual. Would this make sense? What this gets down to is communication. Would adding bells and whistles like interactivity actually help make the material more readable? 

There are two elements to this: 
1. Interactivity would make it more engaging? Is that true? 
2. Interactivity would... lost this train of thought. What else does interactivity help with? 
3. Does it help with communication at all? 
4. How would interactivity distract or harm the overall concept?

**Further Thoughts** - 8/19/19 -
Break it Down. What is communication. What are you doing?

I am transfering information from my brain to theirs. 

Research Where does this breakdown? Other people don't have a perfect representation/copy of my brain so failure of transfer of knowledge is a concept worth researching.

**Idea** - so take this sentence from Super Memo Guru "The main thing that makes a genius brain stand out is its ability to store quality knowledge in a way that is easy to remember and easy to use." This doesn't 100% transfer into my head. Where does it break down? Well I don't know 
1. What quality knowledge is?
2. How does one make it easy to remember?
3. What does "easy to use" mean?

One way is he is setting up a paragraph and this is just the introduction. He then goes on to explain all those concepts. But that didn't transfer into my head they way I'm sure he would have liked. So **the idea for the website is** is to have those be pop up hyperlinks. When they hover on the link it will pop up just like wikiand does. If they click the link it will open it in new page. Do this a lot on your website. 

# Idea 3

What would the creative genius guide look like if you only used images and no written words

Do a sample page or two

Can you do both?
1. Wiki
2. Comic - Gonick Style- words and images
3. Comic - no words, just everything expressed in images
4. abstract somehow even further?

# Idea 4

What if I made the creative genius guide into a question and answer tree structure?

ex. Do you exercise regularly?
* Yes - Do you lift weights and cardio?
  * Yes - Next
  * No - Benefits of each of those
* No - Provide Link to Exersie Model that lays out the Rules, concepts and science behind them

Organized it in a Strategy vs Tactics format. Each section would involve a set of strategys for improvement, then within each section would be a set of tactics for achieving said. [Startegy vs Tactics Diffen](https://www.diffen.com/difference/Strategy_vs_Tactic)
