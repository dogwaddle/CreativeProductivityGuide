# All the information is Stored in the Wiki

The _**wiki**_ is where you are going to house all the information you need as you come across it and organize it. Then in the _**code sections**_, that is where you'll **distill** all the **information** and **create** a **comic book** out of it. 

In the code section you'll have readme files that serve as scripts and then you'll upload drawings of the actual comic pages as you complete them.
